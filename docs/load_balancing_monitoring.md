# Load Balancing Monitoring Strategy

This document outlines the basic monitoring strategy for the load balancing components of the B2C e-commerce marketplace platform.

## 1. External Load Balancer (Nginx) Monitoring

For Nginx, we will monitor the following key metrics:

*   **Traffic Metrics:**
    *   **Requests per second (RPS):** Track the number of requests Nginx is handling.
    *   **Active connections:** Monitor the number of active client connections.
    *   **Bytes sent/received:** Monitor data throughput.
*   **Error Rates:**
    *   **HTTP 5xx errors:** High rates indicate issues with backend services.
    *   **HTTP 4xx errors:** High rates might indicate client-side issues or misconfigurations.
*   **Latency:**
    *   **Request processing time:** Time taken by Nginx to process requests.
*   **Health Check Status:**
    *   Monitor the status of upstream servers as reported by Nginx's health checks.

**Tools/Methods:**
*   **Nginx Stub Status Module:** Enabled in `nginx.conf` (as configured). This provides basic metrics.
*   **Prometheus/Grafana:** Integrate Nginx metrics with Prometheus using the `nginx-exporter` and visualize in Grafana dashboards.
*   **Log Analysis:** Analyze Nginx access and error logs for anomalies.

## 2. Internal Load Balancers / Service Health Monitoring (Docker Compose Health Checks)

For internal service health, we are leveraging Docker Compose's built-in health checks.

*   **Health Check Status:**
    *   Monitor the `health` status of each service container (e.g., `healthy`, `unhealthy`, `starting`).
*   **Service Uptime/Downtime:**
    *   Track when services become unhealthy or restart.

**Tools/Methods:**
*   **`docker ps` and `docker inspect`:** Manually check container health status.
*   **Container Orchestration Tools (e.g., Kubernetes):** In a production Kubernetes environment, health checks are natively integrated, and monitoring tools like Prometheus/Grafana can scrape these metrics. For Docker Compose, consider a simple script to periodically check `docker inspect` output or integrate with a lightweight monitoring agent.
*   **Log Analysis:** Monitor service logs for errors or repeated restarts.

## 3. Database (PostgreSQL) and Cache (Redis) Monitoring

While the primary focus here is load balancing, it's crucial to ensure the backend dependencies are healthy.

### PostgreSQL Monitoring

*   **Connection Status:** Number of active connections, idle connections.
*   **Query Performance:** Slow queries, query execution times.
*   **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, disk I/O.
*   **Replication Status:** If applicable, monitor replication lag.

**Tools/Methods:**
*   **Prometheus `postgres_exporter`:** For detailed metric collection.
*   **Grafana:** Dashboards for visualization.
*   **Database-specific monitoring tools:** e.g., `pg_stat_statements`.

### Redis Monitoring

*   **Memory Usage:** Used memory, peak memory.
*   **Connections:** Number of connected clients.
*   **Operations per second:** Commands processed.
*   **Cache Hit/Miss Ratio:** Effectiveness of caching.
*   **Persistence Status:** RDB/AOF save operations.

**Tools/Methods:**
*   **Prometheus `redis_exporter`:** For detailed metric collection.
*   **Grafana:** Dashboards for visualization.
*   **Redis `INFO` command:** For manual inspection.

## Next Steps for Comprehensive Monitoring

*   Implement a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack, Loki/Grafana).
*   Set up alerting for critical metrics (e.g., high error rates, unhealthy services, low disk space).
*   Establish dashboards in Grafana for a holistic view of the system's health.
